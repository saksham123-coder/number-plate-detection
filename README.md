# number-plate-detection
We have built a python program to detetct the number plate of a moving vehicle through the location or the url of the video.



You will need to follow some steps to successfully run the above code in your system.
1) Make a folder names 'Images'( this folder will be used to temporarily store the images received from frames and extract the nunber plate from it automatically).
2) You will need to install an OCR names tesseract and its python library pytesseract.
3) Place the link of your ip camera or the location  of video in the videocapture function to get going.
4) Most importatntly you will need the xml file which I have attcahed here, This file has been trained to locate the number plate. So make sure to include it.
